#### Intro
I am a software quality assurance engineer at [Marine Learning Systems](https://www.marinels.com/), where my primary role is to ensure the functionality of the software and writing test scripts. My post-secondary education was done at the University of British Columbia where I studied Computer Science and Physics. I am detail oriented, curious about everything software, adaptive to changing scenarios, and very willing to learn.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At Marine Learning Systems I have continued to further develop my knowledge in the world of software, even if it's from the QA side of things. Testing features of the learning management system, creating automated test scripts, and investigating the source code to debug potential issues has allowed me to get a better understanding of what it takes to build a full-fledged application.

I also work part-time at an after-school kids program called Robokids, where I teach and help elementary to high school students with their robotics or coding projects. Technologies taught and used by the students range from [Lego Mindstorms EV3](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313), [Vex Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/home), and [Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/). I have learned how to manage and build relationships with students and parents, and stay patient with those around me. I've also immersed myself in the world of robotics and all these fancy toys that I wish existed when I was a kid :(

#### Interests and hobbies
- Ultimate frisbee. I play on a team in the [VUL](https://www.vul.ca/) every summer
- Ball hockey
- Going for drives on long and windy roads 
- Battling my friends in fantasy sports throughout the calendar year for ultimate bragging rights (and in some cases, money)

#### Fun facts

- I currently am a Mazda enthusiast, thanks to the influence of friends. My first car was [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl7FSa1BZZ_DmWxtZmC5ZZcfXOFbtgeotrgqPs0/), and I am now driving a Mazdaspeed 3.
- I am pretty good with geography as I have a good idea on where countries and cities are in the world.
- I have (almost) forgotten how to ride a bicycle.
