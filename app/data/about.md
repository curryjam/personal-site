#### Intro
I am a UBC graduate of Computer Science and Physics with experience in developing features for web applications and software quality assurance. I am detail oriented, curious about everything software, adaptive to changing scenarios, and very willing to learn. In the immediate future I am looking to advance my knowledge and experience with a role in software development.

#### Currently
I am working part-time at an after-school kids program called Robokids, where I teach and help elementary to high school students with their robotics or coding projects. Technologies taught and used by the students range from [Lego Mindstorms EV3](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313), [Vex Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/home), and [Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/). I have learned how to manage and build relationships with students and parents, and stay patient with those around me. I've also immersed myself in the world of robotics and all these fancy toys that I wish existed when I was a kid :(

#### Interests and hobbies
- Ultimate frisbee. I play on a team in the [VUL](https://www.vul.ca/) every summer
- Ball hockey
- Cars. Whether that be driving them, or working on them 
- Battling my friends in fantasy sports throughout the calendar year for ultimate bragging rights (and in some cases, money)

#### Fun facts

- I currently am a Mazda enthusiast, thanks to the influence of friends. My first car was [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl7FSa1BZZ_DmWxtZmC5ZZcfXOFbtgeotrgqPs0/), and I am now driving a Mazdaspeed 3.
- I am pretty good with geography as I have a good idea on where countries and cities are in the world.
- I have (almost) forgotten how to ride a bicycle.
